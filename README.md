## Employee Salary Calculator
A salary calculator keeps track of employee records and reports monthly salary costs.

Can hold basic employee information, such as:

- First and Last name
- Employee ID

- Annual Salary

Employee records can be deleted and monthly salary costs are updated when records are added or removed.
